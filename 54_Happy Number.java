/* Problem Statement :-
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.
A happy number is a number defined by the following process:-
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.
*/

// Answer :-

class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        HashSet<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();

        while (n != 1) {
            if (seen.contains(n)) {
                return false;
            }
            seen.add(n);

            int sum = 0;
            while (n > 0) {
                int digit = n % 10;
                sum += digit * digit;
                n /= 10;
            }
            n = sum;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
